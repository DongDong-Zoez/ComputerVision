# ComputerVision
This repository  aims at realized easy network architecture

## Colorize picture with Autoencoder architecture

A simple usage of UNet, UNet++, UNet+++ is to color the gray scale image, input a gray scale image and output a RGB image, the network will leran to color the image.

## Image Segmentation

Convoulation autoencoder architecture are widely applied to Image Segmentation, input a iamge with label the boundary, the network will learn to partition the image.

## Objective Detection

We apply state-of-the-art objective detection technique YOLOX on the city potholes dataset
